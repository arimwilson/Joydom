Joydom

A special version of Mexican Train Dominoes dedicated to my grandmother, Joyce Wilson, with whom I played this game for many years. It's a fast moving, dynamic game where your fortunes depend on both your strategic negotiations with your player neighbors as well as on luck in getting a single piece. It supports both local play (with CPU players) and online play.
